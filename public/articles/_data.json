    "heroDesc": "If you were born in the 18th century, you’d be lucky to see your 35th birthday. And if you were one of the few to make it to 50, you’d lived to a ripe old age. Jump forward to now, and it’s safe to say that things have changed a bit.",
    "introOne": "<strong>Imagine deciding to retrain for a completely different industry.<\/strong><br> Imagine deciding to start your own company. Imagine returning to education. Now imagine doing all of those things when you’re 60 years old.",
    "introTwo": "For some reading, this will seem unlikely. For others, it could be unimaginable. But in a reality not far from now, it isn’t. This is no longer the 18th century, and life expectancies have grown beyond those of the 19th and the 20th. One in three babies born today will see their 100th birthday, possibly many more, this statistic will only rise.",

There’s no rush or sense of urgency, they know they’ve got time so they don’t want to commit. House prices have boomed and raising a child is an expensive venture, but it’s still only partially economical. It’s the attitude that has shifted, we’re going to be living longer than ever before, so we don’t need to rush the life changing decisions.<br \/><br \/>Yet, many of us are still trapped in a mind-set that was appropriate when life expectancies were much shorter. We’re still living according to a timeline of a shorter lifespan, when we’re going to be working, living and enjoying life for potentially decades longer. This needs to change, we need to rethink our approach, from finding our footsteps to who we want to be long in to old age.",
    "sectionTwoHeading": "It’s not just the financial and milestone moments that matter",
    "sectionTwoDesc": "We’ll need to reevaluate every action from how we spend our spare time to what we’ll do for a living. Will we really want to pursue a gruelling career, or throw ourselves in to extreme sports when we’re young if our bodies will punish us for longer after? When 25 years of arthritis becomes 45, and a longer life becomes a painful one, will the gift of time be what we wished for?<br \/><br \/>Career breaks are likely to be more commonplace. It’s standard for academics to take a sabbatical, so we may see this trickle down the corporate umbrella. While some may just enjoy the rest , others might retrain and learn new skills for a completely different field entirely. It’s clear the ‘job for life’ no longer exists, career changes are common, so taking a break to retrain entirely feels like the next logical move.<br \/><br \/>It might even become standard practice to study for a career more suitable for our age, one more enjoyable if we continue working into our later years.",

    "sectionThreeDesc": "As it stands, many young adults enjoy a hedonistic lifestyle in their 20s and early 30s, before choosing to look after themselves later. If we live longer, will we become more health conscious from an earlier age? Or will we leave it longer before we start to care? Only time will tell.<br \/><br \/>But one thing will have to change, how we plan to fund our extra years. The standard retirement age is expected to be 68 by 2020, this will only continue to rise. If we don’t want to be working into old age, we’ll need to save more - and maybe start saving earlier. Millions of adults already delay retirement to continue building their pension pot, and if precautions aren’t taken, this figure will only continue to creep up. The sooner you start saving, the more you’ll have. It doesn't have to be complicated.<br \/><br \/>But living for longer will certainly have it’s perks. There’s more time to do your part to look after the planet, leave a better world for future generations and enjoy the years you have. If we rethink our approach to working and saving now, we’ll have less to worry about in the future.  If we do this right, it doesn’t mean we’ll have to work years longer, it means we’ll make our money work harder for us. Then, living longer will be something to look forward to. Quite a lot to look forward to. ",
