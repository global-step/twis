  "about": "Tokyo West International School (TWIS) is an international school affiliated with Global Step Academy  (GSA), which specializes in international education. TWIS consists of a kindergarten, an elementary school, and a middle school. We aim to help pave the way for children to succeed in the world.",
  "program": "Our program focuses on the development of the students’ abilities in five main areas: languages, mathematics, physical education, music, and presentation skills. We believe that just preparing the students for their university entrance exams is not enough, and most importantly it should not be the final aim of education. Education should provide young people with the tools they need to accomplish their life goals. ",
  "offers": "TWIS students can register to take free online lessons every month with Global Step Academy. Students are able to take English classes and other classes taught in English such as mathematics to further improve their English skills.",
  "boost": "We offer a boost program for prospective students who need to develop their English skills in order to actively participate in the lessons at TWIS. Children who do not meet the administration criteria, but depending on their performance in the entrance examination, may be eligible to enroll into our school if they agree to participate in this program.",

  "about-intro-title": "Message",
  "about-intro-p1": "I was honored to be asked to take the position as Head of School from the school year 2017-2018. The school has been growing, and changing, every year since the start 8 years ago. With this year's new organizational restructure and merger with the GSA group, it is my belief that TWIS has taken a giant leap towards becoming a solid institution that truly promotes international minded education and global values.",
  "about-intro-p2": "A school's role in developing a child to be a lifelong learner cannot be underestimated. Changing the way students perceive their own abilities and potential could drastically alter their performance. Rather than praising students based on their talent or intelligence, they should be praised on the process of learning – the effort they put in and the strategies they use, as well as their focus, perseverance, and improvement. This is a role we take very seriously at TWIS. With the introduction of a new international curriculum framework, we will set our focus on these processes of teaching and learning.",
  "about-intro-p3": "Productive relationships between students and teachers form the bedrock of TWIS. Teachers design lessons that allow students to develop our core values - the 4Cs: 'curious (research) skills, 'collaborative (communication) skills', 'courageous (self-management) skills' and 'compassionate (open-mindedness) skills'. Ultimately, your children will be the architects of the 21st century with these skills. To stimulate and promote these skills, lessons are inquiry-based and experiential, require conceptual understanding, and focus on teamwork. Lessons are differentiated in order to make them accessible to the entire class. Local and global concepts and contexts are routinely explored to add depth to learning. Finally, both daily assessments (formative) and end-of-unit assessments (summative) inform all stakeholders of student achievement.",
  "about-intro-p4": "In addition, we will also include an extensive after school program, a new lunch time activity schedule, a summer school program, and out-of-classroom learning; all which makes a unique contribution to a child's education, and offers many varied benefits to them, not least developing the 'whole child' with a sense of place and wonder for the world around them. We strongly believe that academics must not be confined to the classroom, as there are many opportunities for students to extend their learning outside the classroom. After-school activities and outside-of-class activities allows your children to gain an understanding of what it means to live a 'balanced' life. A balanced life consists of intellectual, physical and emotional balance, which equals personal well-being. In this age of the smart phones and video games, activities outside of the classroom act as a counterbalance. So, we strive for our students to find this balanced lifestyle.",
  "about-intro-p5": "It is paramount that honesty and trust form the cornerstone of relationships throughout the school. A school of transparency will allow our mosaic of nationalities to shine even more brightly, and all the stakeholders involved in our school community to be a part of developing our school. If you wish to meet with a member of our administration or staff, then simply email the person in question for an appointment. The Parent Teacher Organization (PTO) also welcomes both new and old families to TWIS. The PTO is there to support all stakeholders in the school. It coordinates school events, fundraising, programs, and activities (both formal and informal). It is a great way for new and old families to form friendships. Matters related to the betterment of the educational experiences are routinely discussed. If you would like to discover more about the PTO, including membership in the PTO, please contact the PTO at pto.tokyowest@gmail.com for details.",

  "about-head-p2": "TWIS consists of a kindergarten, an elementary school, and a middle school. We aim to bring up children who will succeed in the world. In the elementary and middle school divisions, around 40% of the students come from different countries. This creates a rich, diverse environment that allows students to think in a global perspective and grow to become independent individuals, while developing their skills to understand and respect different cultures and people.",
  "about-head-p3": "Additionally, we focus our attention on long term community development, and understanding of diversity, as much as we do on language acquisition, communication skills, ethics, self-awareness, and mindfulness. ",
  "about-head-p4": "We believe that extracurricular activities that parallel classroom lessons and the regular curriculum are important for the student’s development. We put our focus on sports, music, and other after school and club activities where children apply all sorts of skills they have learned in classrooms and put them to use in the process of learning. Learning through these activities allow students to understand what it is like to work both individually and in a group.",
