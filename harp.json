    "homeOneTitle": "<strong>Are you ready</strong> for a longer life?",
    "homeOneDesc": "If you were born in the 18th century, you’d be lucky to see your 35th birthday. And if you were one of the few to make it to 50, you’d lived to a ripe old age. Jump forward to now, and it’s safe to say that things have changed a bit.",
    "homeOneTime": "4",

    "homeTwoTitle": "Are your finances ready for a longer life?",
    "homeTwoDesc": "So you’ve prepared to live longer, but that’s not all you’ll need to prepare for the future. As well as living life to the full and spending time with you’re loved ones, you’ll need to save more for the years ahead.",
    "homeTwoTime": "4",

    "homeThreeTitle": "<strong>When can I retire?</strong>65 is no longer up for grabs",
    "homeThreeDesc": "We look forward to a longer life, but there is a catch. The State Pension age has previously neglected the increases in life expectancy, which means many adults now spend a third of their adult life in retirement. The government are now tackling this by increasing the State Pension age and abolishing Default Retirement Age (DRA). If you're unsure how this affects you, or when you'll be able to retire, read on.",

    "homeFiveDesc": "When we think about volunteering, work experience during our school holidays or an elderly tour guide leading us through a National Trust home often springs to mind.",

    "homeSixTitle": "10 new ideas about to change your life",
    "homeSixDesc": "Emerging technology isn’t all about talking robots and machines to replace us at work. Here’s a list of the new ideas that we’re excited to see emerging in the next few years.",
    "homeSixTime": "8",

    "homeSevenTitle": "Money-making hobbies",
    "homeSevenDesc": "A lot of people embrace retirement like a very long holiday. They’re suddenly gifted the time to enjoy their hobbies, take a trip of a lifetime and make up for all the lost time they’ve missed whilst working. But once they’ve satisfied their itchy feet and seen their loved ones ten-times over, there’s a chance they might find themselves at a loose end. Below are the top ten money making hobbies that retirees are using to get creative with earning a little extra in retirement.",
    "homeSevenTime": "8",

    "homeEightTitle": "The retirement of the future",
    "homeEightDesc": "The future is changing, we'll soon have more to look forward to, and other things to budget for. The price of a pint of milk may soar to above a pound, but we'll also be soaring to distant planets for our holidays.",
    "homeEightTime": "3",

    "homeNineTitle": "Fit for life",
    "homeNineDesc": "You’ll never be able to turn back the clock, but as you get older you can play to your strengths when it comes to your health and fitness. As we age our nutritional needs change. Whatever your fitness levels, here’s a run down of how your body’s needs change in your 20s, 30s, 40s and beyond.",

    "homeTwelveTitle": "Fit through the ages",
    "homeTwelveDesc": "Walking into a gym five years ago, you’d be taken aback to spot an 80 year old giving it some gusto on the treadmill or bench pressing 100kgs. Times have changed though, and pensioners are shunning the recommended 150 minutes of modest exercise a week in favour of a more rigorous training regime.",
    "homeTwelveTime": "3",

    "homeThirteenTitle": "Meet the new <strong>friendship groups</strong>",
    "homeThirteenDesc": "We can’t put a value on friendship, it keeps our metal wellbeing in balance and countless studies show that close companions help us live longer and our bodies fight off disease. We now live in an age when the 100 year life expectancy is becoming a reality and social media is bringing strangers together. This makes us to ask, why are multigenerational friendships still a somewhat rarity?",
    "homeThirteenTime": "4",

    "homeFourteenTitle": "10 benefits from multigenerational friendships",
    "homeFourteenDesc": "There’s plenty of great things that happen when you form multigenerational friendships, and you’ll learn a few new things along the way. Here’s our run down of the best things that happen when you mix outside your typical age group.",
